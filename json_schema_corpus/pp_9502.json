The creation endpoint validates the changes and then schedules the batch to be executed returning a batch\n**id** to check the result later on.\nThen the __GET__ (show) endpoint can be used to check the completion of the scheduled batch, using the **id** returned by the\nprevious __POST__. Once the batch has finished, the result will be included in the batch object.",
