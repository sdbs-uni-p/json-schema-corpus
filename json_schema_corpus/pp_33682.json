  "description": "Scores may be reported as supporting information about the learner\u2019s attempt. Since reporting systems may not have a passing threshold to compare the scores the activity provider or activity cannot imply success or completion of an activity solely based on a score. The use of this Statement is for journaling/auditing purposes and does not necessarily indicate the score of the activity. If it is determined that the activity must have a score, set it explicitly as the result of terminated Statement. NOTE: For compatibility between SCORM versions, the value of SCORM 1.2 `cmi.core.score.raw` divided by 100, and of SCORM 2004 `cmi.score.scaled` should be reported to xAPI as `score.scaled`. All other scores - raw, min, max - may be reported directly as xAPI `score.raw`, `score.min`, and `score.max`.
